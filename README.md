Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/PandeyHarsh433/Resygo.git
cd Resygo


Install dependencies:
npm install


Set up environment variables:

Copy the .env.example file to .env:cp .env.example .env


Update .env with your Supabase credentials:VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key


Find these values in your Supabase project dashboard under Settings > API.


Run the development server:
npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.


Supabase Setup

Create a Supabase Project:

Sign up at Supabase and create a new project.
Note the project URL and anon key for the .env file.


Set up the reservations table:

In the Supabase dashboard, go to Table Editor and create a table named reservations with the following schema (adjust as needed):id: uuid (Primary Key, auto-generated)
user_id: uuid (Foreign Key, references auth.users)
restaurant_name: text (not null)
date: date (not null)
time: time (not null)
party_size: integer (not null)


Enable Row-Level Security (RLS) to restrict access to authenticated users (e.g., users can only view/edit their own reservations).


Enable Authentication:

In the Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Providers.
Enable Google OAuth or email/password authentication and configure the necessary credentials (e.g., Google Client ID and Secret from Google Cloud Console).
Update the redirect URI to match your app (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for development).



Usage

Browse Reservations: View available reservation slots or your booked reservations on the homepage (/).
Book a Reservation: Navigate to the booking form to reserve a slot by specifying the restaurant, date, time, and party size.
